3. Keeping in tradition of DAVPS Pushpanjali Enclaves quest for innovation, the school participated 
in an All India Competition on Innovative Practices and Experiments in Education for schools and 
Teacher education Institutions for the year 2014-15. The school picked up a remedial project 
DECODING MATHEMATICS where the students suffering from fear of Maths were selected and 
taught in a diverse manner. After effective execution and implementing our 35-point innovative
 teaching strategies, we were successful to explore students experiences of mathematics. On 
26th June, 2015 we were invited to present our report at the National Seminar held at the NCERT 
Campus. Our project was competing with schools and teacher training institutes from all over
 India. It was a pleasure to have been selected for the NCERT Award for the year 2014-15. 
The award incorporates a cash award of Rs. 20,000 /- along with a certificate. After the success of 
the Maths Project ? DECODING MATHEMATICS? has now become a regular feature of the school
 and part of the curriculum so that the fear of Maths can be overcome. The school is also 
envisaging a desire to envision and implement a similar project in other subjects, too.

The Library is the nerve centre of the school
Our School has a well furnished Library, with a rich collection of various types of books, under 
the charge of a well-qualified Librarian. Library periods are provided to all the classes in which 
they visit the Library to read the magazines, books and encyclopedias etc. Besides, they utilise 
these periods for getting the books issued too, to study them at home.
Following the wealth of wisdom in this saying, the school has collected a substantial no. of books 
on wide ranging disciplines to quench the children's quest for knowledge. A qualified dedicated
 librarian perseveres to upkeep the library along the principles of library science. Library period 
introduced in the daily routine will go a long way to inculcate reading habits, the real means of 
obtaining pleasure and knowledge.</span>
