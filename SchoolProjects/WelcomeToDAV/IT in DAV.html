<br><h2>

The introduction of smart boards in the school was a significant shift to the IT world
in DAV Pushpanjali. School found that it had made the learning process easier 
along with making the students visualise things more efficiently. It is a way making students learn 
new things by connecting them to the outer world with help of computer and Internet. Smart boards can be considered 
as the maximised or developed form of computers. In labs it has now become easy for teachers to demonstate practicals
on smart boards and for the students to understand those practicals easily as well as quickly. 
It has also become much easier for counsellors to take workshops
and sessions for related to topics like career, internet etc. with help of smart boards.

<br><h2>

The school finds that the Robotics education is essential to 
inculcate a skill to design interesting, movable and animated electronics projects. 
It harbors creativity, encourages students to think, discuss among each other and build 
innovative designs to solve the problems. The Robotics activity starts from Class VII. 
The students begin by learning that a whole computer can reside on a chip on a robot. 
It is a pleasure to see the kids when they download and see in action their first program on 
the robot. Their sense of achievement and excitement is unmatched.
