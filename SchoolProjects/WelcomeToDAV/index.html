The school was established in January 1989 with 400 students on roll and 20 staff members 
teaching and non teaching) to begin with. In a short span of time it made a quantum leap and 
made a phenomenal progress. At the ripe young age of 24 the strength has reached the toll of 
4,000 students and 200 staff members teaching and non teaching). The School has traversed a
 long eventful journey and has entered into the 25th year or the Silver Jubilee Year since, its 
inception. Desire, Motivation, Determination and Commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of 
our goal - a commitment to excellence has enabled us to attain the success we sought. 

The school now boasts of a sound and well developed infrastructure with 90 spacious and well
 ventilated classrooms that have been transformed into e-pathshalas equipped with Digital Smart 
Boards, the state of art laboratories for Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, Geography, 
Psychology, JIL labs, Computer Lab on each floor, Conference room for meetings and seminars and 
a Computerized Library. 

The school believes in setting clear visions and challenges for laying a healthy foundation by 
creating a sustainable environment, that is the key to human existence. Our students ponder, 
probe, train, exert to bring about a wonderful alignment of all the faculties for a distinctive and 
qualitative achievement, to realize the individuality and uniqueness without compromising the
 human touch, refinement of the heart and discipline of the spirit. The school has become an 
institution to be reckoned with. It has not only carved a niche for itself but also enjoys great 
renown of its own. It has forcefully arrived and is here to stay. The excellent results each year, 
at every level speak for themselves. 
We can proudly say that the school has blended the modern with the moral and ethical 
successfully and has maintained the highest character all through. This in itself is a great 
achievement. It is a new beginning for us today and we have to move past what we are now, 
innovatively with a new clarity, goals and commitment. Success for us is not a destination; it's a
 never ending journey.</span></font>
